# Twitter COVID-19
In this project, we wish to explore the extent of polarization on Twitter. Our goal is to identify ideological communities corresponding to the pro-vs-anti vaccine movements, the nature of their interactions, to provide us with an approximate score of the extent of polarization, and to determine whether each of these communities share a common set of interests.

# Mention Network
The ```2021-07-01-hydrated_tweets.mention_network.gpickle``` file is in the google drive [2021-07-01 dataset - get_metadata output](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1xcFGbn6iHpBmGZ6CCSHjKHF_m5iZRgAZ)

# Environment Variables
The file twitter_api_investigation.py requires a .env file. Create one with the following structure:
```
CONSUMER_KEY=
CONSUMER_SECRET=

OAUTH_TOKEN=
OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=
```
Refer to [Twitter Developer documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps/overview) for information about getting a dev account and proper access (e.g., a consumer key)

# Running get_metadata.py
This assumes you have the .env file set up.

get_dataset_tsv.py also has a --date flag for convenience.

NOTE: these are instructions for Windows using Git Bash

## Sample
These are the runs I did. Note the directory. Follow this structure, but don't use these dates as I have already hydrated tweets for these days.
```
python ./data_acquisition/get_metadata.py -i ./data/tsv/2020-04-10-dataset.tsv -o ./data/tweets/2020-04-10/2020-04-10-hydrated_tweets -k api_keys.json

# Important Dates
Refer to [Issue #2](https://github.com/cagri32/Analyzing-the-Extent-of-Polarization-around-COVID-19-Policies-using-Social-Media/issues/2#issuecomment-970665240)

Given that the media is a primary driver of the intensity of social media user response, the following countries are prioritized by widespread media coverage of COVID-19 events, in order, with their reasons;

* USA - Has significant global media and economic influence, strong interest in global media due to the Trump administration at the time
* China - Had the first identified cases, has significant economic influence, strong interest from Western media
* Italy - Was an epicentre of the pandemic in the early stages
* Australia - Specifically Melbourne, Victoria state, was eventually used as a example of authoritarian pandemic response, by critics
* The rest of the world.

It is possible that although later dates may seem relatively significant, there could be a weaker response to them. This is because some studies have identified that media coverage of the pandemic is decreasing in spite of a "deepening crisis" - possibly from information fatigue.
