# Analyzing-the-Extent-of-Polarization-around-COVID-19-Policies-using-Social-Media
In this project, we wish to explore the extent of polarization on Twitter. Our goal is to identify ideological communities corresponding to the pro-vs-anti vaccine movements, the nature of their interactions, to provide us with an approximate score of the extent of polarization, and to determine whether each of these communities share a common set of interests.
